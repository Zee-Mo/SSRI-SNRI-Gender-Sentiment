Just from missing one dose, it gave me withdrawal symptoms that lead me into the Emergency Room 2 nights in a row. It was the worst experience of my life. "

" Anonymous |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient ","9/20/2023","I was on venlafaxine for a little over a year after bring diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Started at the lowest dose of 37.5mg and ended up going all the way to 150mg. It was awful getting on the drug and even worse going up. I don’t think this is the drug I needed and possibly was misdiagnosed, so that could be why it didn’t work in my favor. Long story short, this drug caused me to test positive for PCP and made me behave in ways I have never before. It was a long spiral downhill from beginning to end and had to work very hard to get my life back on track. It was definitely a huge learning experience for me. Read More Read Less  "
"Kelly | 55-64 | Female |   Patient ","8/17/2023","This medication is horrible , made me feel crappy. I only took one pill and I felt like I was going crazy. Severe nausea , trembling , hot flashes . My dr or the pharmacist never told me about it being highly addictive and hard to come off . Never ever taking anything again !! "
"Venlafaxine  | 45-54 | Female |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient ","7/27/2023","Horrible side effects and even worse are the withdrawals. It's almost impossible to get off this drug without horrific withdrawal symptoms. On top of that, most doctors dismiss your side effects, don't know how to taper you off this drug and when you get withdrawals they blame it on your original condition (relapse) or diagnose you with something else adding more drugs. It should be criminal what these doctors are doing to people. "
"Terry | 65-74 | Female |  On medication for 10 years or more |  Patient ","7/17/2023","Initially placed on 75 mg for mild depression due to the change of life. A different doctor suggested I go up to 225 mg stating it could help me with dizziness issues. Worst thing I ever did. I’m in a living hell trying to get off this medication."
"Cuzd1010 | 55-64 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient ","7/5/2023","This medication is EXTREMELY addictive. It will cause horrible side effects. Dizziness, brain zaps, severe mood swings, nausea 
And just overall feeling unlike anything you have ever experienced trying to get off this medicine. They say opiods are addictive. If they're more addictive than effexor. I have some prime oil land for sale in Maine 
For anyone who believes that bs from the pharmaceutical companies. It should be against the law for this medication to even be on the market. You can't even miss 1 dose without feeling side effects. It will take you 2 to 3 months to get off.of this and you'll feel worse than you ever have. Read More Read Less  "
"None | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 2 to less than 5 years |  Patient ","6/14/2023","I was put on this medication as my mood stabiliser alone wasn’t controlling my depression. I have schizoaffective bipolar and part of that is severe depressive episodes. I also have terrible anxiety. I was suicidal when I was put on venlafaxine and within a few weeks my depression and anxiety were much improved. The combination of medication helped me go back to work and function better. I feel much more calm. Good medication. I’m coming off of it to get pregnant as an article by the CDC shows it can harm unborn babies.Read More Read Less  "

"Anonymous | 45-54 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient ","5/3/2023","I started taking zoloft for anxiety and depression at age 40 and had good results for more than 10 years.  In my early 50s it stopped working even at the maximum dose of 200mg.  I switched to effexor with no problems from the transition.  Over the last two years on the effexor I have had some good periods of time but also some bad periods that have lasted for months.  I decided to try something else.  I am currently taking Lexapro while tapering down on the effexor.  After one month, both my depression and anxiety are bad.  I don't know if its the reduction in effexor, ineffectiveness of the Lexapro, or just the illness itself.   Read More Read Less  "
"Kt | 19-24 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient ","4/13/2023","It really helps with my depression, but not so much my anxiety. For the first few weeks of treatment, I felt very strange. But it goes away after 4-5 weeks. It took a while to kick in, but it’s really nice to have relief from depression. It also helps me focus which is nice. I’m on 150mg."
"Sunny | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient ","3/27/2023","I was prescribed 37.5mg for severe anxiety and ptsd. WORST DECISION of my life ever. I only took it for three days and within those three days I had the most HORRIFIC panic attacks ever. I was extremely paranoid, anxious, and could not concentrate or think straight. I had insomnia, nausea, and loss of appetite.  The side effects were horrible! It's been about a month since I stopped taking it and I still have side effects. It really affected my vagus nerve as well and now I'm more anxious than before and feel more sickly than before. It did not work for me sadly. Read More Read Less  "

Probably wouldn't be here today if it weren't for effexor.
Side effects were mainly nausea, and nightmares, which lasted for the first couple of weeks, and that's it. 
Worked alot better for me than prozac. A life-saver."
"InsertNameHere | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient ","3/16/2023","I have had many bad side effects from other depression medications (celexa, gabapentin, lexapro, etc). So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "
"S Adams | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient ","3/6/2023","Venlafaxine made me seriously ill. For the 12 days I took it I was bedridden. I shook continuously, couldnt eat, rest or sleep. I've never sweat so much in my life. Horrible drug."
"Bill | 65-74 | Male |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","3/5/2023","This is the worst medicine I have ever taken. Its side effects say rage. I took it for I don’t know how many months. I started having incredible rage episodes where I wanted to fight people. I got really out of control. My doctor said I wasn’t afraid to die or anything. My doctor took me off of it quickly and it took five weeks of withdrawals. I would not recommend this medicine to anybody."
"Suzan | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient ","3/3/2023","I love Effexor. I’m 27 and used Wellbutrin before and honestly loved what it did for my depression but it made me very aggressive and irritable. My doctor switched me to Effexor and initially I had some bad emotional blunting, but once I adjusted it felt like the sun was shining on me for the first time. I still have some intrusive thoughts (like everyone), but it is so much easier to dismiss them as irrational. My social life has bloomed, I am a better mother, and I’m not bothered by much at all. I’ve never felt so mentally stable or capable. I finally am feeling like a “normal” person for the first time ever. Read More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | 45-54 | Female |   Patient","5/24/2012","I was prescribed Effexor xr by me PCP. I had some improvement but it didn't seem to change much of my symptoms. I finally got in to see a Psychiatrist and he changed my medication, adjusting to lower the Effexor and increasing the new medication. The first reduction from 225mg down to 150mg caused me horrible mental distress and many other problems. The worst was extreme rage which I had to be prescribed another medication for it because I could not control my anger and could not tolerate any kind of emotions I had. Until my Psychiatrist talked to me and I understood it was the medication, I knew I was in for a hard time. It's been 3 months backing off and I'm just now at 75mg this week and have another 6 weeks to go before I can try staying off the Effexor. I think this medication can be helpful for a lot of permanent problems, but I think it's a catch all pill the PCPs prescribe because it's supposed to cover so many problems. I would recommend going to a Psychiatrist to be diagnosed and get on the proper medication the first time. I'll never let a regular doctor diagnose my mental state again. I could have easily not continued my life because I couldn't handle the withdrawals until the Psych DR. put me on the medication to keep the rage under control. Most people I talk to that have taken this medicine have gotten off it because the unbearable problems it causes.Read More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | Female |    ","9/18/2007","Coming off of this drug is like being addicted to heroine!! DO NOT TAKE THIS!!!!!!!!  the dizzy spells, crying spells, nausea, confusion, weird dreams, ect. you name it! i would rather be depressed then go through this!!!"
"Healed4good | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","2/12/2008","Treatment wasn't bad...until I decided to go off of it. I was given a heavy dose 300 mg/day. On it for ~18 months. Started to reduce the dosage and what I call 'neurochemelectrical discharges' started zapping my brain. It was tolerable and expected. Kept reducing the dosage slowly as directed. Finally made it down to 37.5mg/1x day and the 'neurochemeletrical' circus was raging...but slightly tolerable. Went totally off and felt like I was back in college having the worst psychadelic experience of my life. Called the Dr. and picked up two more titration packets with the 37.5s and eased them back in and then started staggering them every other day and longer. My brain finally settled down a little. I was ready to stop again, and did so. I was still seeing (and mostly feeling...tracers) but they were tolerable. I was off for 8 days...yes 8 (eight, 7+1, etc.) so it was out of my system but the psychadelic party was still going. I broke down and took a 75mg capsule I had...just in case... Bottom line. THIS STUFF IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET OFF OF! Please consider this if your Dr. suggests it. Believe me, I know how bad things may seem, but please consider all options. I now have to start the original (or generic) Effexor at 25 mg for 7 days and then split them to 12.5 mg for 7 days. I am pretty tough (now anyway...) by most standards but this (withdrawl) is, in my opinion, worse than depression. I know how to take care of that now without meds. Just please look into it before getting on it. Read More Read Less  "
"Jessie | 19-24 | Female |  On medication for 2 to less than 5 years |   ","10/8/2007","I had a horrible time while I was on this medication.  My PCP put me on this right before I left home for college.  She thought the stress I was going through was related to depression but the fact was I was scared to move 15 hours away to go to school.  I was on this medication for 2 years and if I missed a single dose, I would feel the withdrawal symptoms immediately.  I would have trouble walking, very unsteady (like I was 80 years old), extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, weakness, tired all the time.  When I tried to stop taking the medication, I couldn't go more than 2 days even with 37.5 mg.  Finally, I just had to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and laid on a couch for a whole week until I was completely detoxed.  It was the worst experience of my life...and the medicine did nothing to help my ""depression"".  RESEARCH everything before you start taking something that you know nothing about.  Don't trust your doctor just because they went to medical school.Read More Read Less  "
"LC | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for 5 to less than 10 years |  Patient","9/19/2007","This drug has saved my sanity.  I have been on and off Effexor 3 or 4 times.  If you do not go off of this drug slowly it can cause terrible side effects.  If taken as the doctor prescribes, it is great."
"Frank | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |   ","9/18/2007","I started out with 37.5 mg as recommeded by my Doctor for a week. Then upped the dosage to 75mg as directed.  After I would say 6 months I wanted to cut back down to the 37.5 dossage.  I went off the charts. I went back to the 75mg, and since now I am at 150mg.  I hope that someday I will not have to take this anymore, but at this time it seems unlikely."
"BBs3 | 55-64 | Female |  On medication for 10 years or more |  Patient","11/7/2015","I have been using this for 15 years.  Same 75 mg  dosage.  No side effects at all.  Was very sad but noticed after about a month that things did not bother me as much.  It was very gradual.  Helped a lot.  No need to try to get off.  Why would anyone try to stop taking a medically necessary prescription?  If your brain has ceased making the necessary amount of serotonin to keep you stable, it is never going to get better.  You need to STAY on your meds.  People have caused their own problems by trying to stop taking meds on their own. Their doctors would have told them that if they had the sense to ask.

"JennyT | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient","1/11/2015","Ive been taking Effexor for about a week now and I must say I have never felt better.  I have more energy and feel the need to get out and join the world again.  Ive been a prisoner of my own depression for about 5 years now and was apprehensive about taking any medication to treat it.  The medication Ive been prescribed in the past had little to no effect.  Effexor has completely changed everything for me.  I feel far more effective in day to day tasks and am finally looking forward to the future.Read More Read Less  "
"slushyboots | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient","11/6/2007","I have been on effexor XR for a month and a half now, and have just adjusted my dosage from 75mg/day to 150mg/day, I have found it very easy to use, NO nausea/tremors, and only experienced slight headaches/trouble sleeping but I had that anyway. I am trying to be patient so that I can have relief from depression, and not worry about what the drug is doing to me. It affects EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY so please don't be scared of what others report about THEIR side effects. If you find it doesn't help keep your mood steady and positive, try something else like adding therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy to your 'arsenal of support'  Do not go off effexor cold turkey, this is stated everywhere and many people ignore this warning, which causes problems. Warnings and directions are there for a reason and following the instructions can help you to have a more positive, healthy experience with anti-depressants. I hope this has been helpful for those of you considering effexor for depression/anxiety or whatever it may be for you, and know that ANY step toward getting help for yourself is a good one!! also, congrats for educating yourself first!  good luck everyone.

"calichase | 45-54 | Female |  On medication for 5 to less than 10 years |  Patient","11/27/2012","I'm getting off this medication by taking a regiment of Omega 3 complex and vitamin B12 ... seems to be working. Started on the medication for treatment of general depression. Wasn't informed by doctor of any side effects or withdrawal symptoms until I called panicked after skipping a dose. Long-term use created subtle issues that were hard to pin to the medication -- tiredness, muscle aches, headaches, hot flashes (gone now). Advice for those who want to stop: Try following suggestions of the website ""The Road Back,"" a nonprofit organization that specializes in getting people off this type of medication. Omega 3 complex (fish oil) mellows brain zaps for me and for the first time I have been able to reduce the dosage. Down to to 37.5 after taking 150 for nearly 9 years. Will quit for good in a week.

"LULU1971 | 35-44 |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","6/21/2016","Listen to me, do not and i repeat do not take this medication.  yes, it helps with depression because it completely wipes out all emotion, good or bad.  you cannot get off this stuff without suffering severe withdrawl symptoms, not limited to but including: wishy washy brain zaps, dizziness, joint pain in shoulders, elbows, knees and knees. it is not easy at all to get off of.  i am off of it and i do believe it has caused joint damage and brain damage to my body.  be aware!!!"
"Crocodile1 | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","10/5/2009","Effexor XR is not effective until you get to the 150mg threshold.  It is FDA approved up to 225mg/day, but many doctors prescribe way higher than this with good results.  I saw one post on here where the person said the drug didn't work and they were at 37.5mg/day.  Yes, the drug will have virtually no effect on you at that low dosage!!    I've been on it a year and I'm at 300mg/day.  It is a wonderful medicine, but I don't like the sweating and the fact that it raises blood pressure.  People, DO NOT trust your primary care or family doctor to know about these psychoactive drugs.  They mean well, but a Psychiatrist is where you need to go for the guys who know everything about psychoactive drugs.  Also, I am not a doctor, nor do I work for a drug company.  I just wanted to throw some facts out there for people to use so that they can be helped.  Read More Read Less  "

"effexor VICTIM | 55-64 | Female |  On medication for 2 to less than 5 years |  Patient","6/30/2009","THIS IS A HORRIBLE DRUG!!!!! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!! DO NOT TAKE!!!I have watched my mother, who has never taken a recreational drug in her life struggle with this drug almost killing her (literally) from the withdrawl symptoms. She began taking it to treat her hot flashes and depression and built up to 225mg. All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug. She stopped taking the drug and began to feel like she was shutting down, physically and mentally. I have struggled with opiate addiction for a few years now and i think there is no worse feeling than the withdrawl you experience when quitting. that was until i saw my mom go through this. she went to the hospital for what she was feeling (not knowing it was effexor withdrawl) and they told her that her body was literally shutting down. Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the effexor. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages. And thats just the symptoms that wont actually kill you!!!Just take the time to research the class action lawsuit against Wyeth. And the thousands of blogs about the people going through the same things i have described here. Please just don't take this drug, i wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.Read More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | 19-24 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient","12/16/2014","Effexor has been really good. I've had depression, PTSD, anxiety, and never wanted to take pills for it, but after a major upsetting event in my life, I pretty much had no choice and was forced into it by loved ones. Crappy time emotionally. But, I was SURPRISED by the results. It works. It doesn't make my life 100% amazing or even 75% and all problems go away instantly in any means, I get really sad still, but I can function. For anyone struggling to see improvement when taking anti-depressants, please don't give up. After my first drug didn't work, I was so done with it all but agreed to try ONE more time for something and it's working.

"Mom40 | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |   ","12/23/2021","I have never written one of these types of reviews but found myself looking for personal experiences of this drug when I was prescribed it and found that super helpful.
I'm a 40-year-old mother of two who has suffered from an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. My life was drama and chaos - always thought people were upset with me, didn't like me, were talking about me, etc. I couldn't drive without thinking about getting in a horrible accident or panic every time my kids wanted to play outside with their friends.
I went on Cipralex a few years back and it helped a bit, but I also gained about 10 lbs and still had some anxiety. About a month and a half ago I was prescribed Effexor and I was nervous about taking it as I had read so many scary reviews. Still, I also read a lot of positive ones so thought I'd give it a whirl. I started off at the the lowest dose and gradually increased each week until I got to 150mg. I felt super tired, dizzy and nauseous the first few weeks, which led me to easily losing 5lbs. At around the 1 month mark I started feeling AMAZING. I feel so calm, centred and content, which is something I have never felt before in my life. I'm about to spend Christmas with people who normally cause me so much anxiety and stress, but I am not anxious about it one bit. I have heard it is tough to come off of this pill, but I honestly don't think I'll ever want to go off of it. I keep eating chips, junk food and haven't really been working out lately but have now lost 8 lbs without trying at all. My biggest tip would be to take the pill in the morning as when I took it at night I couldn't sleep. Only side effect I'm experiencing is constipation.Read More Read Less  "

I live my days very calm now, and my relationships don't suffer anymore. I can't imagine going back to those extreme highs and lows.

I'm a 40-year-old mother of two who has suffered from an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. My life was drama and chaos - always thought people were upset with me, didn't like me, were talking about me, etc. I couldn't drive without thinking about getting in a horrible accident or panic every time my kids wanted to play outside with their friends.
I went on Cipralex a few years back and it helped a bit, but I also gained about 10 lbs and still had some anxiety.

It may work for some, however I'm sure there is something better on the market that is far less addictive if you ever plan on coming off of it!     I was prescribed this for anxiety/OCD and as far as how well it worked, I only noticed a slight difference. I felt a little less anxious, but it also made me completely numb to all other emotions too. Another side effect I noticed--I lost all of my sex drive.    When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor agreed that I should go off of this since it wasn't doing much anyway. This has proven to be a real nightmare! I took me 3 whole months to come off of it. For those of you who are struggling to come off of this now, I'll offer the method I used:   I split open the pill, counted the ""beads"" into even amounts and took each amount for about a week until my body adjusted to it. Doctor's can prescribe lower dosage amounts, however, the jump from one dose to another may be too much of a shock to your system. For example, I jumped from the 150 mg I was taking to 75 mg, then started the bead counting to completely come off. That jump was pretty intense let me tell you!

I don't know if its the reduction in effexor, ineffectiveness of the Lexapro, or just the illness itself.   Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now.

My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now.

My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now.

My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now.

My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it. 
Also if you’ve had issues with bad side effects with your depression medications, I highly recommend asking about Genesight testing- this test helps show your doctor what medications work best with your metabolism.Read More Read Less  "

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

So I have gone unmedicated for many years. I hit a suicidal breaking point this year with my depression and anxiety, and was prescribed Effexor. At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now. My anxiety is still not well managed- when something sets it off i don’t feel like the Effexor is doing much for it and I’ll feel anxious the rest of the day (I’ll be talking to my psychiatrist about it next week). But I am so far happy with how Effexor has made me feel and I’m glad I tried it.

At first I was extremely tired, and extremely nauseous. Now 3 weeks in I mostly just have some issues with dry mouth and a little fatigue, but every day seems better. My depression doesn’t seem as heavy and my emotions feel more level and I do feel like I’m able to laugh more and feel calmer now.
