"mammalea | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient ","12/3/2023","Depression- this medication worked great for me. With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

It takes minimum 4 to 6 weeks to work or to have any effect at all on how you feel.  For me, it did work.  Was actively suicidal.  Am no longer, w 4 yr of treatment.  Good luck to you out there, you have to give it time to work..  BD-1"
" Anonymous | Female |   Patient ","10/18/2023","Very disappointed this medication didn’t work from me. I have suffered my whole life with GAD, panic attacks, and now agoraphobia. My doctor prescribed 10mg Lexapro and within an hour of taking it my skin was burning, chest pain, vomiting, ear ringing, and spinning. I was afraid to take it again for one week and I cut the dose to 2.5 mg. My body was finally able to adapt to 2.5 mg after 3 months, but I cannot increase it without severe side affects. On such a low dose it hasn’t helped my anxiety at all and now I get consistent brain-zaps, tingling, and a spacey feeling through the day. Doesn’t work for everyone I guess! Read More Read Less  "

I thought I would be weak if I used it but I feel opposite. I felt strong that I laid down my pride and take the medication. 
First six weeks is pretty bad, you feel the same and might experience nausea and headaches like I did. After 4 weeks I started feeling a little better then after 8 weeks is when it kicked in big time. I was so content and felt like I can breathe again. I was on 10mg from May 2022 - April 2023. The only side-effect throughout the entire time taking it is fatigue. I was constantly tired.   Read More Read Less  "

It started working almost immediately (I didn’t have the 2 week period of depression/anxiety that most have for some reason) and I feel like a normal human on it. I no longer obsess over things and I just feel like I am functioning normally for the first time ever. I highly recommend. I really haven’t had too many negatives on it.. I have been drowsy and had crazy dreams but other than that everything has been going amazing."
"Heffer | 25-34 | Male |   Patient ","9/5/2023","I took this for focus an anxiety. I worked to a extent. Best side effect was lasted longer in bed. Worst side effect, I had cardic arrest. Probably from the prolong QT side effect. But doctor wouldn't say it was the medicine. He has no clue why I died and put a ICD in my chest. Since off this med, I know longer have prolong QT an only took Lexapro. So it's safe to say I died from this medicine. But I'll say everyone is different with meds. I just wish Lexapro people would hear from people like me that want them to know about the rare cases that AINT BEING REPORTED like my case. I'm not looking for money. Just need Lexapro to know of issues like mine

" Anonymous | 65-74 | Male |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","8/29/2023","I took the drug for six weeks. I could not sleep, loss of appetite and burning in feet and hands.

"LeighAnn  | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient ","8/19/2023","STICK WITH IT!! 

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | 45-54 | Male |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","8/17/2023","I switched to Lexapro from Effexor for depression and anxiety.  I started at 5 mg and then increased the dose by 5 mg each week until I got up to 20 mg.  Unfortunately, the Lexapro did not help with either anxiety or depression.  I did not feel any benefit and then I began having insomnia limiting my sleep to 3-4 hours per night.  I stuck with it for 7 weeks and then stopped.  Disappointing."

I thought I was going to die and if I had been made to stay on it, would have wanted to.  Everyone begged me to stay long enough to let me get full benefits.  I was so sick and depressed couldn’t get out of bed and didn’t want to see anyone.  I couldn’t live like that and they finally agreed. I came off, not exactly like my Dr.said but not suddenly.   After a week I’ve had some problems. I’m having some good days and some not.  Today I had flashbacks of those bad days, anything is better than while on the Lexapro.Read More Read Less  "
"Meec | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient ","5/29/2023","I have taken zoloft and Prozac for many years. None have made me feel this good. I'm in a great place right now.  I used to be angry all the time. I got fired from every job I ever had. And I lost every girl that ever loved me because of my horrible personality, attitude,  irritability and rudness. This med puts me in a great place. A great mood. I'm not afraid to speak to people. Not afraid to say no. Not afraid to speak to strangers. I almost feel like im this special person that can connect with anyone. Manybe I'm wrong. But it's good that I can feel this way. I used to have crippling anxiety and depression. Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!!

"katielady | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","5/2/2023","About a month ago, I had, basically, a complete mental breakdown after being triggered due to my PTSD. I mean, my life did a complete flip. I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "

"don't suggest | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","11/4/2007","The doctors don't tell you this, or maybe most of them don't know.  I took Lexapro for a couple of years to deal with depression from a stressful job/condescending boss.  It did work, but when I stopped taking it I started getting brain jolts, zaps in my mouth, dizziness, vertigo type feeling when I would move my eyeballs, spinning when I would move my eyeballs, and I also had headaches.  It is very hard to explain the symptoms, but you know it when you are dealing with it.  I was absolutely miserable.  I didn't know what it was from and ended up at many doctor's offices thinking I had a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, you name it.  They gave me an MRI of my brain, lots of tests, you name it.  Finally I did some of my own research on the internet and found that there a LOTS of other people that were going through the same thing.  I just had to type in the right thing in google and there it was.  There were so many people with the same problem, not only from Lexapro but other anti-depressants as well.  You would think doctors would know!These horrible things finally went away after about 6 months of torture.  I don't wish what I went through upon anybody.  I guess if you are never planning on getting off the meds then you are ok, but if it's just a temporary thing then I would recondisder.  The withdrawl symptoms are just too much.  I was also suicidal during the withdrawl.  It is out of my system now and I am clean of anything and feel much better.  If only one person reads this and listens to me it will be worth it to save them from something like this.  Read More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient","9/28/2014","After a terrible experience with fluoxetine in the past, I was hesitant to try any other SSRIs, but lexapro has been a real life saver. I started taking it for depression and GAD, and about a month after I got up to 20mg/day, it finally kicked in and I feel amazing. I no longer feel utterly hopeless and useless; I don't dwell constantly on negatives or worry incessantly about everything (in fact, I can't even -force- myself to ruminate, which is a weird feeling); I'm actually cheerful 90% of the time and hardly ever have down days anymore; and I feel a lot more confident and outgoing and actually comfortable around people. Overall, lexapro has made me so much more positive and relaxed and, well, ""normal"". I can finally just get on with things and enjoy life instead of moping around and worrying. And I don't feel like it has blunted my emotions at all either, which is something I heard a lot about beforehand. Plus, apart from some heavy tiredness and constant yawning during the first couple of weeks. I haven't had any side effects (no weight gain, thankfully!), so that's a huge plus. Now I just hope that these wonderful effects actually last!Read More Read Less  "
"snoopmom | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 2 to less than 5 years |  Patient","11/8/2007","I was recently weened from Lexapro after being on it for a little over 3 years; I found it to be a wonder drug. In the past I tried Paxil and Prozac and did terrible on both. Lexapro basically saved my life. I do remember when I started the medicine I would have extremely vivid dreams at night that didn't make sense and it took a few months for that to subside. One downside of the medicine is that I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight; I'm only 5'1"", used to always weigh around 115/118 lbs, and I ballooned up 144 lbs. The drug manufacturer doesn't state weight gain as a side effect, but everyone I know who has been on the medicine has stated the same thing. I religiously watched my diet and couldn't lose the weight; this is actually the reason I went off the medicine. I am in a much better place, both emotionally and mentally, than I was before starting Lexapro, but I found the weight gain to be something that made me more depressed and miserable.

" Anonymous | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for 2 to less than 5 years |  Patient","2/19/2009","DISCONTINUING LEXAPRO IS HELL.     Most doctors do not warn patients about SSRI DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME, so please research this before deciding that Lexapro is right for you.    Lexapro was fairly effective at easing my depression, but every time I missed a dose, I felt sick.  Because of this, and the sexual side effects (complete inability to orgasm, no arousal during sex, no interest in sex), I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and let me tell you, DISCONTINUING LEXAPRO IS HELL.  PLEASE, please before taking Lexapro, look up SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome on Wikipedia. It has been over a month since I finally tapered off Lexapro, and I have felt sick the whole time.  It's like having the flu every day but it doesn't go away, and the feeling of being ""zapped"" every few minutes is VERY disconcerting.  I am only JUST starting to feel better, however I still get major headaches every day, I feel like I have a low-grade fever and my body still hurts most of the time.    If you do take Lexapro, DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. TAPER OFF VERY SLOWLY to lessen the very unpleasant effects of discontinuing it.  My doctor had me taking 50mg/day, which sounds like a lot, but it took that much to be effective for me. But nobody warned me that I would have to take it the rest of my life or suffer the misery of discontinuing it.   Lexapro can be a very effective medication, and the benefits of taking it can outweigh the problems it may cause, so do the research and make an educated decision based upon your personal needs.  Keep in mind that WebMD is sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, so you probably won't find anything about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome here unless you are reading what patients have submitted.    Please research carefully and thoroughly so that you understand exactly what you are getting into if you do decide to take Lexapro.  Read More Read Less  "
"JP | 35-44 | Female |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient","5/9/2015","I've always had intense anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anorexia, EDNOS, anxiety disorder.     A year ago, after a 20-year battle, I admitted myself into residential treatment for an eating disorder. The eating disorderwas my coping mechanism to self medicate, in a sense: starvation made my highs less intense and gave me purpose during my depressive lows.    Without my usual coping mechanisms, the depression didn’t lift. After two months wondering what the point of it all was, in nearly unbearable physical and mental pain, with NOTHING I could think of that would make me happy, I realized I needed help.    So I saw a psychiatrist who put me on 5 mg of Lexapro.    The very first day, I felt it. I know that’s rare, but I’m super sensitive. I entertained the possibility of it being a placebo effect, but I know it’s not. How?    Well, I’ve been a nervous sweater my whole life. I drench my clothes in tense situations, in freezing cold, in heat. The first day on Lexapro, the sweating went from excessive to normal. This is not something you can change with a placebo effect.     The pain in my chest started to ease, I noticed colors and sounds and smells in a pleasant way rather than not noticing them at all, or being totally overwhelmed by them.    I could face the everyday tasks that had felt impossible before. I started feeling for the first time in my life, “This must be a bit what it feels like to be a normal person.”    It’s been two and a half weeks. I had a few side effects initially: dry mouth, clenching jaw, foggy head, loss of appetite, hot puffy hands and feet, and a surge of foggy exhaustion for about two hours after taking my morning 5 mg pill.    It subsided within a week. It’s completely even now.    I have a full range of emotions. I don’t feel the meds now. I just feel like I can breathe a little better. I have a little more strength to face the every day things. I even feel joy again now and then. Read More Read Less  "

Constant anxiety, no sleep, mind did not stop running, felt like my body was flying away from me in all different directions.  Got close to a total mental break down.  Was given Lexapro, 10/mg daily, within a week I was sleeping & started to be able to cope again.  No side effects, no weight gain.  After 1st year, needed a refill & was terrified MD would not refill because I felt wonderful on it.  I took it for another year (2 years total).  Mom passed away & hubby in remission.  Felt I needed to try life again without it.  I weaned myself off over a 2 month period skipping days inbetween until my last bottle was gone.  Two months was not long enough for the 'weaning period', I had most of the withdrawal side effects already mentioned off & on for about 6-8 months after.  It wasn't fun, but my only regret is that I did not 'wean' long enough.  If I ever needed it again, it would be my drug of choice.  However, I would do a much longer weaning period & research how to do so correctly. It's a wonderful drug to get you through when life events are too much to handle.         Read More Read Less  "

I thought that it might make me zombie-like and not able to experience emotion but it did not do that at all.  The only negative side effect that I have noticed is difficulty waking up to my alarm in the morning (late to work everyday now because I can't get up) and drowsy while at work.  I am a 44 yo female and take 10mg at bedtime.  I read that I might be able to take 5mg in the morning and 5mg with dinner and that might help with the drowsiness.

"takeatnight | 19-24 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient","1/17/2010","Comment:  Lexapro has saved my life. I was prescribed the drug for severe anxiety and mild depression. The first time I was on it, I took it for about 3 months in the morning and I had the sexual side effects, loss of libido and I could not have an orgasm to save my life!! I stopped taking it because I could not handle the sexual side effects. Then when my doctor prescribed it again he told me that it should ALWAYS be taken at night!!! It helps with the drowsiness, which was my 1st problem because I felt like a zombie in the morning when I took it. So when I started taking it at night, I noticed that I STARTED TO HAVE ORGASMS RIGHT AWAY!! Now I take it before bed every night, and I have orgasms all the time! I want everyone to know to talk to your doctor about taking Lexapro at night!! The side effects are non-existent! It saved my life, TAKE IT AT NIGHT!!      Read More Read Less  "
"CLL | 45-54 | Female |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient","12/10/2009","This website has been SO valuable during my frustration with different medications. You need to read over ALL the reviews and rule out a few that don't seem to jive with all the others.  There's always a few out there who are dissatisfied. That doesn't mean those same things will happen to you.  Do your research and remember, everyone is different and react to drugs differently.      Don't be scared the first time you see a reviewer mention weight gain or decreased libido.  It's more important that you get to feeling better and you can deal with those things later.     I've had depression for 30 years and Prozac 20mg worked for me up until I hit 50. Perhaps it was because I'm pre-menopausal or because I'd taken the same drug, at the same dose for so many years.  I went to the doctor and tried several other drugs. At first, I wasn't satisfied with any of them, so I got on Effexor XR.  Wow!  Please read about the withdrawl symptoms when going off of Effexor, because they are severe. Try all the other meds first. Something will work for you.    Bottom line, I'm going back on Lexapro.  I don't think I gave it enough of a chance and it was working pretty well for me. Be patient and don't try to change meds or get off of something without a doctor's advice.  Been there, done that, and it was terrible.  I believe that Lexapro is a wonderful drug. It is sure the best I've tried so far. I believe our bodies get used to something and it finally stops working. That's what happened to me with Prozac, although it was my wonder drug for 20+ years. I'm going to ask my doctor if perhaps I should rotate between Lexapro and Prozac every few years. That may be the answer for me.    DON'T GIVE UP. Antidepressants will help you get your life back, but you have to be patient. Also exercise, eat right, and talk to someone who cares. God bless you all and best wishes in your recovery.    There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.    Read More Read Less  "
"drtobe | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","4/16/2009","I've been on Lexapro for a year and have been very pleased with the results.  Take it for depression/anxiety combo.  Started out on Lorazepam for anxiety attacks, but quickly realized I needed a daily medication.  Had used Xanax for a short period a few years ago, but I like the Lexapro because it isn't habit forming (I'm sure there are withdrawal symptoms, but it isn't addictive).  Started at 10mg, which worked fine until I was laid-off earlier this year, so I switched to 20mg.  Doing fine on 20mg and plan to stay.  Lexapro has made a huge difference in my life - I used to have trouble sleeping, was disinterested in life in general, often wondered what the point of living was, and would constantly worry about EVERYTHING.  I felt improvement of my depression within 1 week of receiving the prescription.  A word on side effects:  I too felt EXTREME fatigue, nausea, terrible headaches, and lack of appetite in the first couple of days.  I was taking it in the morning before going to work and I honestly felt AWFUL within an hour of taking it - but the depression was getting better so I hung in there with the medication, figuring the side effects would go away once my body adjusted to the medication.  I also switched to taking the medication at night right before I went to bed instead of in the morning, so any side effects would occur while I was sleeping and I didn't feel them as much.  Thankfully making that switch did the trick and as far as I know the side effect went away after the first week or so.  Give it time if you're just starting or thinking about starting.

I cried all of the time, had crazy mood swings and was just never happy.  Since taking Lexapro, all of that has gone away and I'm much more well balanced and happy.  The side effects I've experienced are weight gain (30# in 3 yrs), no sex drive, fatigue, yawning, and increased sweating.  While I would much prefer not have the side effects, I feel they're a fair trade for restoring my sanity and my life!Read More Read Less  "

Definitely a very strange feeling. I have experienced weight gain of 20  lbs in 6 months, trouble falling asleep at night but experienced extreme fatigue constantly.  I thought I was becoming an alcoholic I was craving alcohol.  I have also experienced restless leg, intense itching on both arms and excessive sweating.

"mhg123 | 19-24 |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient","5/7/2016","So I became depressed after a traumatic death of my only sibling. I'm not a fan of taking drugs to ""fix"" a symptom (I consider depression to be a symptom of a larger problem) but I was so behind in everything and I needed to get myself up to speed again so my doctor prescribed 10mg of Lexapro and told me to take it at night. It was horrible. The first night, I took the drug and went to sleep. About an hour later, I woke up and threw up violently then proceeded to have wave after wave of panic attacks for the next 5-6 hours. The next night, I took the drug and told myself that the first night was probably just my body adjusting to the new medication and that I would be fine and it wouldn't happen again. But it happened again. And again. And again. I had constant panic attacks for about 2 weeks before I just stopped taking the drug. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't sleeping at all. And my doctor had the nerve to tell me that I caused the panic attacks - but I wasn't causing them - I'm well versed in panic attacks and I know when I'm causing them and when they just happen. I don't recommend just stopping the drug like I did because that could REALLY MESS YOU UP but I made sure I was watched for a couple days after I stopped taking it in case something happened. The antidepressant part actually did work - I felt a lot better and that ""heavy cloud"" feeling was gone but I just couldn't handle the panic attacks so I decided to deal with the depression on my own and it took longer than I wanted but it's gone now and I didn't ever go back on a drug to do it.

"Cmk | 25-34 | Male |  On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year |  Patient ","4/9/2022","Lexapro gave me my life back.

After years of untreated anxiety and depression, I was at a major turning point in my life. My mental health was causing my relationship with my partner to deteriorate. I couldn’t sleep. The smallest inconveniences would cause my anxiety to spike and I would spiral. My relationship with my family was extremely toxic. I was in therapy but resisted medication for years.

My doctor recommended that I try Lexapro for 9-12 months. It’s the best decision I’ve ever made with my life.

I’m less emotionally reactive, able to make friends easier, and don’t feel like I have a depressive fog looming over me anymore. My partner and I are also closer than ever. I’m not sure where I’d be today without it. Lexapro was exactly what I needed to get me over the hump - which therapy alone just couldn’t do.

I gained about 15-20 pounds while I was on Lexapro. But I think that’s a small price to pay to get your life back and feel like you’re finally living. I still have my days and episodes of course, but they’re not nearly as severe nor frequent, and I feel more confident about my ability to handle them in a healthy way.

Lexapro might not be for everyone. But for those who it is, you’ll wonder why you waited so long.Read More Read Less  "

Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things i used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects.

"tpakido | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for 1 to less than 2 years |  Patient","1/10/2013","Rx'd for Anxiety, GAD, MDD. After being on Zoloft for several years, when my depression and Anxiety spectrum returned we decided to try Lexapro. It just never felt 'right' from day 1. After several months, I noticed the feelings did not improve and I figured I would need to live with it. I tried varying doses, from 5 MG up to 20MG. Nothing worked. Now almost a year since starting, I've made the switch back to a low dose of Zoloft. Within weeks, I again feel 'normal' and I am not plauged by the overall unease I felt on Lexapro.     More specifically, the negative: increased anxiety, developing agoraphobia, EXTREME laziness and no motivation, obssessive thoughts and headaches, jaw clenching/bruxism caused a bit of damaged to my TMJ, memory became an issue, cost (even the generic.) Withdrawal, even on a taper back over to Zoloft, is difficult. A lot of agitation, anger and headpains/aches that are beyond description.    The positive: hardly any sexual side effects. Upon first taking it one year ago, for a few weeks there was a bit of unexpected euphoria. For me, that was short lived and slowly the negative impacts crept in.     Being mindfull now, everyone IS different. We all are wired uniquely and our chemistry varies--other conditions may add or detract from how a drug works for you. I know many people who love Lexapro and it has worked well for them (interestingly, the ones I know have all been female! Just coincidence, but interesting). It wasn't for me, though. Which is why I always suggest to keep trying until you find something that works.Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

This med puts me in a great place. A great mood. I'm not afraid to speak to people. Not afraid to say no. Not afraid to speak to strangers.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!! Don't struggle with depression or anxiety. There is help!!!!  You are loved!!!!Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority.

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good.

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one).

Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason.

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing.

Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!! Don't struggle with depression or anxiety. There is help!!!!  You are loved!!!!Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority.

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good.

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one).

Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason.

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing.

Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!! Don't struggle with depression or anxiety. There is help!!!!  You are loved!!!!Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority.

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good.

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one).

Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason.

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing.

Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!! Don't struggle with depression or anxiety. There is help!!!!  You are loved!!!!Read More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority.

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good.

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one).

Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason.

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing.

Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing.

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk.

I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later:

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

It takes minimum 4 to 6 weeks to work or to have any effect at all on how you feel.  For me, it did work.  Was actively suicidal.  Am no longer, w 4 yr of treatment.  Good luck to you out there, you have to give it time to work..  BD-1"
" Anonymous | Female |   Patient ","10/18/2023","Very disappointed this medication didn’t work from me. I have suffered my whole life with GAD, panic attacks, and now agoraphobia. My doctor prescribed 10mg Lexapro and within an hour of taking it my skin was burning, chest pain, vomiting, ear ringing, and spinning. I was afraid to take it again for one week and I cut the dose to 2.5 mg. My body was finally able to adapt to 2.5 mg after 3 months, but I cannot increase it without severe side affects. On such a low dose it hasn’t helped my anxiety at all and now I get consistent brain-zaps, tingling, and a spacey feeling through the day. Doesn’t work for everyone I guess! Read More Read Less  "

I thought I would be weak if I used it but I feel opposite. I felt strong that I laid down my pride and take the medication. 
First six weeks is pretty bad, you feel the same and might experience nausea and headaches like I did. After 4 weeks I started feeling a little better then after 8 weeks is when it kicked in big time. I was so content and felt like I can breathe again. I was on 10mg from May 2022 - April 2023. The only side-effect throughout the entire time taking it is fatigue. I was constantly tired.   Read More Read Less  "

" Anonymous | 19-24 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","9/7/2023","Lexapro changed my life! It started working almost immediately (I didn’t have the 2 week period of depression/anxiety that most have for some reason) and I feel like a normal human on it. I no longer obsess over things and I just feel like I am functioning normally for the first time ever. I highly recommend. I really haven’t had too many negatives on it.. I have been drowsy and had crazy dreams but other than that everything has been going amazing."
"Heffer | 25-34 | Male |   Patient ","9/5/2023","I took this for focus an anxiety. I worked to a extent. Best side effect was lasted longer in bed. Worst side effect, I had cardic arrest. Probably from the prolong QT side effect. But doctor wouldn't say it was the medicine. He has no clue why I died and put a ICD in my chest. Since off this med, I know longer have prolong QT an only took Lexapro. So it's safe to say I died from this medicine. But I'll say everyone is different with meds. I just wish Lexapro people would hear from people like me that want them to know about the rare cases that AINT BEING REPORTED like my case. I'm not looking for money. Just need Lexapro to know of issues like mine

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "
" Anonymous | 45-54 | Male |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","8/17/2023","I switched to Lexapro from Effexor for depression and anxiety.  I started at 5 mg and then increased the dose by 5 mg each week until I got up to 20 mg.  Unfortunately, the Lexapro did not help with either anxiety or depression.  I did not feel any benefit and then I began having insomnia limiting my sleep to 3-4 hours per night.  I stuck with it for 7 weeks and then stopped.  Disappointing."

I thought I was going to die and if I had been made to stay on it, would have wanted to.  Everyone begged me to stay long enough to let me get full benefits.  I was so sick and depressed couldn’t get out of bed and didn’t want to see anyone.  I couldn’t live like that and they finally agreed. I came off, not exactly like my Dr.said but not suddenly.   After a week I’ve had some problems. I’m having some good days and some not.  Today I had flashbacks of those bad days, anything is better than while on the Lexapro.Read More Read Less  "
"Meec | 35-44 | Male |  On medication for less than 1 month |  Patient ","5/29/2023","I have taken zoloft and Prozac for many years. None have made me feel this good. I'm in a great place right now.  I used to be angry all the time. I got fired from every job I ever had. And I lost every girl that ever loved me because of my horrible personality, attitude,  irritability and rudness. This med puts me in a great place. A great mood. I'm not afraid to speak to people. Not afraid to say no. Not afraid to speak to strangers. I almost feel like im this special person that can connect with anyone. Manybe I'm wrong. But it's good that I can feel this way. I used to have crippling anxiety and depression. Right now, I'm able to keep a girlfriend. I would say that I can keep a job. But right now I own a business. So no more jobs for me. Ok, sexually, I used to be a one minute man. But now it takes a little longer to ejac. But it's perfect timing. My sex drive is strong. I'm more affectionate. I used to be afraid to kiss a woman because of my anxiety. But nit I kiss and Romance a woman better than I ever have in my life. Zoloft and Prozac took my sex drive down to zero. Lexapro seems to boost my sex drive but only slightly delays ejac. And that's perfect for me. As I said I'm naturally a one minute man lol ??. I don't feel like I'm high on drugs. I feel like I'm high on my awesome life!!!!!!!!!!   I used it think my life was worth ending because I'm a horrible person. But now I think I have a lot to offer the world!!!! Try lexapro. Maybe it can change your life too!!! Don't struggle with depression or anxiety. There is help!!!!  You are loved!!!!Read More Read Less  "
"katielady | 25-34 | Female |  On medication for 1 to 6 months |  Patient ","5/2/2023","About a month ago, I had, basically, a complete mental breakdown after being triggered due to my PTSD. I mean, my life did a complete flip. I am a very independent person but after this, I couldn't be alone, I couldn't drive, I was in a complete dissociative state and severely depressed as well as anxious. I started taking Lexapro but my symptoms didn't change. I had pretty much given up hope and had accepted that I'd never be the person I was. Luckily, I have a great support system who constantanly reminded me that all things take time. Around week 4 of taking Lexapro, I woke up one morning and felt more like the real me than I had in what seemed like an eternity. I am happy to report that since that day, I have been feeling better and better each day. My advice to those of you just getting started on Lexapro: just give it time. Read More Read Less  "
